                        (3,200 km). To

                    <p> Australia has been called “the Oldest Continent,” “the Last of Lands,” and “the Last Frontier.”
                        Those
                        descriptions typify the world’s fascination with Australia, but they are somewhat
                        unsatisfactory. In
                        simple
                        physical terms, the age of much of the continent is certainly impressive—most of the rocks
                        providing the
                        foundation of Australian landforms were formed during Precambrian and Paleozoic time (some 4.6
                        billion
                        to 252
                        million years ago)—but the ages of the cores of all the continents are approximately the same.

                    <p>
                        Claims that Indigenous Australians are the most ancient continuous civilisation on Earth have
                        been backed by the first extensive study of their DNA, which dates their origins to more than
                        50,000 years ago.

                        Scientists were able to trace the remarkable journey made by intrepid ancient humans by sifting
                        through clues left in the DNA of modern populations in Australia and Papua New Guinea. The
                        analysis shows that their ancestors were probably the first humans to cross an ocean, and
                        reveals evidence of prehistoric liaisons with an unknown hominin cousin.

                    <p>Australia's climate is governed mostly by its size and by the hot, sinking air of the subtropical
                        high pressure belt (subtropical ridge or Australian High). This moves north-west and north-east
                        with the seasons. The climate is variable, with frequent droughts lasting several seasons,
                        thought to be
                        caused in part by the
                        El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Australia has a wide variety of climates due to its large
                        geographical size. The largest part of Australia is desert or semi-arid. Only the south-east and
                        south-west corners have a temperate climate and moderately fertile soil. The northern part of
                        the country has a
                        tropical climate, varying between grasslands and desert. Australia holds many heat-related
                        records: the continent
                        has the hottest
                        extended region year-round, the areas with the hottest summer climate, and the highest sunshine
                        duration.

                    <p>
                        Australia is the driest of all inhabited continents, with considerable rainfall and temperature
                        variability both across the country and from year to year. Australia has a wide range of daily
                        temperatures, with summer temperatures ranging from of 5.7°C in New South Wales to 30.8°C in
                        Queensland, and to 8°C in Tasmania.
