                spectacular
                beaches.
                Many of these gleaming beauties grace lists of the best beaches in the world, and with more than 10,000
                beaches
                in Australia to choose from, you're sure to find the perfect stretch of coast for your favorite
                activity,
                whether it's surfing, snorkeling, swimming, or sunbathing.</p>

                    <p>This perennially packed Sydney beach makes it onto most "Australia's best" lists -- for good

                        Aside from its enticing union of white sand, curling waves and sandstone cliffs, Bondi also
                        offers a
                        host of diversions: achingly cool cafes and bars, an ocean pool chiseled into the rocks, weekend
                        markets and an annual alfresco sculpture festival that sees larger-than-life installations
                        erected
                        in the surrounding parkland.
                    </p>
                    <p>It also comes with significant history, being the birthplace of the Surf Life Saving Club -- the
                        world's first was established here in 1907, the same year Bondi bathing suit protests paved the
                        way
                        for bikinis to become common beach attire.</p>

                        is
                        composed of 98% pure silica -- essentially, this means it is so impossibly white and powder-soft
                        that it actually squeaks when you walk on it.</p>
                    <p>It also means that it doesn't get hot, which is a good thing, because the sun in this pocket of
                        Queensland can be intense.</p>
                    <p>You can get to the island by boat or helicopter and spend the day hiking to lookouts, snorkeling
                        in
                        a blindingly turquoise sea the temperature of bath water, or sipping Champagne under casuarina

                        postcard-perfect harbor is where pink granite peaks meet a clamshell-shaped beach of powdery
                        sand,
                        fading into a sapphire sea that is eye-poppingly pretty -- but also pretty cold (Antarctica is

                    <p>It's regularly voted one of the top coastal coves in the world, let alone Australia, despite its
                        rather gruesome past: The bay takes its name from the country's whaling era, when the waters
                        here
                        were stained red with blood.</p>

                    <p>While this seemingly endless beach on Queensland's Fraser Island is stunningly scenic, it's
                        not one
                        you should visit for sunbathing and swimming.</p>
                    <p>A landing strip for light aircraft and a designated highway, the long stretch of sand is
                        commonly
                        used by 4WD vehicles circumnavigating this slip of land -- the world's largest sand island
                        and the
                        only place in the world where tall rainforest grows from the sand.</p>

                    <p>Aside from being able to drive along it, the beach is known for its extremely photogenic
                        Maheno
                        shipwreck, not to mention dramatic volcanic rock formations at Indian Head.</p>
                    <p>If you do want to take a dip, turn off your engine at Champagne Pools, a series of sandy,
                        shallow

                    <p>As its name suggests, this sandy cove in Far North Queensland has long been a popular spot for
                        those
                        who like to snorkel and sunbathe sans swimming costumes.</p>
                    <p>While the state is the only one in Australia to not have a legal nudist beach, clothing here is
                        optional, so put away your camera. Located on Fitzroy Island north of Cairns in the Great
                        Barrier
                        Reef, Nudey's combination of sand and bleached coral makes it a little harder under foot than
                        most,
                        but any discomfort walking -- just pack a pair of beach shoes -- is well outweighed by the
                        backdrop.
                    </p>
                    <p>This is a place where the rainforest meets the reef and then smudges into an artist's palette of
                        blues, from ice-mint to azure and aquamarine. The good news is, you don't have to leave -- check
                        in
                        to the barefoot-luxe Fitzroy Island Resort and linger on Nudey as long as you like.</p>

                    <p>Never heard of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands? You'll want to familiarize yourself, because these

                        Australian landfalls are home to one of the country's most scenic stretches of coastline.</p>
                    <p>Way out in the Indian Ocean (closer, geographically, to Indonesia than Australia), the
                        archipelago's
                        27 tiny islands and coral atolls are like a beacon for white-sand beaches, palm trees and
                        blissfully
                        blue lagoons.</p>
                    <p>The star is Cossies on Direction Island, a favored pitstop for visiting round-the-world yachts.
                        You can circumnavigate the entire islet in less than an hour, which leaves plenty of time for
                        lying
                        on the sand -- which you'll likely have entirely to yourself -- or snorkeling the teal waters in
                        search of German ship SMS Emden, which sank here during the Battle of Cocos during World War I.
