                Although there
                are blocks of

                the inner cities, then a sprawl of suburbia stretches out for miles and miles.</p>

                        <p>Kangaroos are the world’s largest marsupials. A Red Kangaroo can weigh 90kg and can grow two
                            metres
                            tall. Black Wallaroos, at around 20kg, are the smallest species (their name a portmanteau of

                            some of the world's most venomous species, you are unlikely to come across one unbless you

                        <p>Australia has a number of highly venomous spiders, including the Sydney funnel-web
                            spider, its
                            relatives in the family Hexathelidae, and the redback spider, whose bites can be extremely
                            painful
                            and have historically been linked with deaths in medical records. Most Australian spiders do

                            have venom that is considered to be dangerously toxic. No deaths caused by spider bites in
                            Australia have been substantiated by a coronial inquest since 1979.</p>

                        <p>Australia is known for its dangerous snakes, and they have many – but in reality few people
                            die
                            from
                            bites. WHEN IT COMES TO self-defence, Australia’s snakes have things pretty well covered. We
                            share
                            our continent with about 170 species of land snakes, some equipped with venom more toxic
                            than
                            any
                            other snakes in the world.</p>

                        <p>But bites are actually quite rare in Australia and, since the development of anti-venom,
                            fatalities
                            have been low – between four to six deaths a year.</p>

                        <p>“This is in contrast to India, for example, where bites may reach one million a year, with
                            over
                            50,000 deaths,” says Associate Professor Bryan Fry, a herpetologist and venom expert at the
                            University of Queensland. “Snake bites are very, very rare [in Australia] and often the
                            fault of
                            the
                            person being bitten. Most bites occur when people are trying to kill a snake or show off.”

                        <p>The Dingo is Australia's wild dog. It is an ancient breed of domestic dog that was introduced
                            to
                            Australia, probably by Asian seafarers, about 4,000 years ago. Its origins have been traced

                            to
                            early breeds of domestic dogs in south east Asia (Jackson et al. 2017).</p>

                        <p> Domestic dogs are descended from the Grey Wolf (Canis lupus). While recent DNA studies
                            suggest
                            that
                            Dingoes may have been in Australia for longer (Oskarsson et al 2011), the earliest

                            archaeological finding of the Dingo in Australia has been dated to 3,250 years ago (Balme et

                        marsupial
                        carnivores, closely related to the Tasmanian devil and the quolls, that live in deserts and
                        spinifex
                        grasslands of arid Australia. They are nocturnal, but occasionally "sunbathe" in the entrance of
                        the
                        burrow in which they dwell. Their kidneys are highly developed to excrete extremely concentrated
                        urine to preserve water, as the animals rarely drink. They feed mostly on insects, but also eat
                        reptiles and small mammals. They are seasonal breeders breed from June to September. The pouch
